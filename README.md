### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-employed, full-stack, software and database architect with just over 20 years of experience in writing, supporting and deploying software solutions to human problems.

I've just started getting a GitHub portfolio together (the majority of my work has always been proprietary and for in-house only) in order to demonstrate my skillset. 

### So far, I can do:

Frontend
--------
Expo.io, React, React Native, HTML5, Pug, CSS3, Stylus, JavaScript, API and TypeScript.

Backend
-------
NodeJS, NPM, Express, rest API, TypeScript and Express middleware. I also have written in VB.NET/ASP.NET, however this skill hasn't been needed for a long time!

Databases
---------
MySQL, MSSQL and MongoDB.

Tools
---------
GitHub, Bitbucket, VS Code, Postman, HeidiSQL, MongoDBCompass and Mongodb.com.

Deployment and Hosting
----------------------
Firebase, Heroku, cloud (clouding.io, DigitalOcean, Vultr, etc) and traditional.
